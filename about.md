Oh hey, Kate Jones here. Having had two kiddos in the last four year has made me reevaluate everything. What am I focusing my time on and why? What do I want to be doing, how do I make the time away from my kids and husband really count. I just keep coming back to my love of simplifying and minimalizing to focus on building the life I love. Isn't that what we all want? To live a life we are truly passionate about? So here I am, writing this, letting you see this side of me in the hopes that we can work through the chaos of life to focus on what really matters. I know it's different for everyone but for me, it means managing my own schedule, being around for all of the key family moments and doing things I'm passionate about.

I LOVE minimalizing and simplifying everything from my home to my schedule to finances so I can deliberately choose how I am filling my time. As a warning, I'm a huge fan of self improvement for the sake of a happier, healthier life. Because of that I like to dive head first into new routines, new ways to streamline so I have time for what makes me happy.



Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

This page is a good place to write about yourself, your project, your product, or whatever it is your site is for. You can replace the image above, or you can get rid of it entirely.
